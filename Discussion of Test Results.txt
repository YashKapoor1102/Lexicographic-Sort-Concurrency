Discussion of Test Results

- I tested my program thoroughly with different lists of letters. 
  Also, I made sure my program was error-free by inputting several values and 
  ensuring my program would not crash.

  Below are two data sets that I tested:


Test Data Set #1 (Mandatory Data Set):

Input: X, A, z, M, W, y, D

Output (User chooses debug mode): 


Unsorted List:  x a z m w y d

Do you want to run this program in debug mode? (Y/N): Y  



Process P1: Performed Swapping
Process P1: No Swapping

Process P2: Performed Swapping
Process P2: Performed Swapping

Process P3: Performed Swapping
Process P3: Performed Swapping

List in lexicographic order: a d m w x y z 



Output (User does not choose debug mode): 


Unsorted List:  x a z m w y d

Do you want to run this program in debug mode? (Y/N): N 

List in lexicographic order: a d m w x y z 





Test Data Set #2 (Additional Data Set):

Input: Q, H, t, b, U, S, a

Output (User chooses debug mode): 


Unsorted List:  q h t b u s a
Do you want to run this program in debug mode? (Y/N): Y


Process P1: Performed Swapping
Process P1: No Swapping

Process P2: Performed Swapping
Process P2: No Swapping

Process P3: Performed Swapping
Process P3: Performed Swapping

List in lexicographic order: a b h q s t u 



Output (User does not choose debug mode):


Unsorted List:  q h t b u s a

Do you want to run this program in debug mode? (Y/N): N 

List in lexicographic order: a b h q s t u 



Conclusion:

After manually converting the two lists mentioned above into lexicographic order, I can conclude
that my program sorts the array of distinct letters correctly. Specifically, it is evident that
the first and second lists sorted in lexicographic order are indeed (a d m w x y z) 
and (a b h q s t u), respectively. Hence, my program is functioning the way it is supposed to.
